## Pablq App

This app fetches schedule and scores data from the four most popular American professional sports leagues.

It is the app version of [my personal website](http://www.pablq.website/).

You can see the website source code [here](https://github.com/pablq/pablq-website).

I built this app in order to try out SwiftUI.

Requires Xcode 12.
